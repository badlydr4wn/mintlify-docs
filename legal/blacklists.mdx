## About Blacklists

### What are blacklists?
Blacklists are an internally used modifier for both users and guilds (servers) that prohibit the use of Compass's features.

### What do blacklists affect?

#### For Users
- **All Application** and **Text Commands** from the Compass application will not be available.
- **All Interactions** and **other interfaces** with the Compass application will not be available.
- **Limited support** will be available from [official contacts](#contact-us), and for any servers using Compass managed by blacklisted users.
- **Commands** and **Interactions** targetting or mentioning blacklisted users will remain available.

#### For Guilds
- **Guild-based Application** and **Text Commands** from the Compass application will not be available.
- **Guild-based Interactions** and **other interfaces** with the Compass application will not be available.
- **Limited support** will be available from [official contacts](#contact-us).
- **Globally-enabled Commands** and **Interactions** non-exclusive to guilds will remain available.

### How long do blacklists last?
The duration of blacklists, both user-based and guild-based, will either be temporary or permanent. To enquire if your blacklist is temporary (and for duration) or permanent, contact Compass Administration from either of our [official contacts](https://compass.badlydr4wn.xyz/legal/terms-of-use#contact-us). Duration of certain temporary blacklists may also be displayed in interactions while using a blacklisted account or guild.

## Appealing Blacklists

### Removing a false blacklist
If you are concerned and/or have valid evidence that a blacklist against your guild or user was incorrectly issued, please enquire to either of our [official contacts](#contact-us) and provide said evidence if requested.

### Appealing temporary blacklists
Temporary blacklists can be appealed at any time unless they are being appealed within 1 month of expiry, in which you will have to allow the blacklist to naturally expire. Successfully appealed temporary blacklists will be revoked entirely.

### Appealing permanent blacklists
Permanent blacklists are only issued in serious cases, you will be asked to provide suffecient evidence to support your reasoning for appeal. Successfully appealed permanent-blacklists will either be revoked entirely or changed to a temporary blacklist of varying duration.
